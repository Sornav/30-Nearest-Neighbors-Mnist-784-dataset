# 30-Nearest-Neighbors-Mnist-784-dataset
In this project,I applied the Kth Nearest Neighbor Algorithm on the "mnist_784" data set with 30 different values of K ranging from 2 to 30 ,and calculated the train and test accuracies for each of the k values and stored them in two different arrays,and then found out the k values with highest test and train accuracy,upon finding out the best k values,I trained my KNN classifier with the best k value(for test accuracy) and calculated the confusion matrix,and then i visualized the two arrays for train and test accuracies using matplotlib and plotly.

**Note:I usually visualize my data by using Plotly Library,so if you are having trouble viewing them in the GitHub viewer, you are free to clone my repository on your local machine and check them out in jupyter notebook,other wise follow the step below.
