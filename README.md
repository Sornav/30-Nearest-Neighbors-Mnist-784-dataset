# 30-Nearest-Neighbors-Mnist-784-dataset
In this project,I applied the Kth Nearest Neighbor Algorithm on the "mnist_784" data set with 30 different values of K ranging from 2 to 30 ,and calculated the train and test accuracies for each of the k values and stored them in two different arrays,and then found out the k values with highest test and train accuracy,upon finding out the best k values,I trained my KNN classifier with the best k value(for test accuracy) and calculated the confusion matrix,and then i visualized the two arrays for train and test accuracies using matplotlib and plotly.
